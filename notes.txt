Prerequisites:
LangChain Knowledge: Familiarity with concepts such as chat models, templates, and the basics of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is required. Knowledge of the LangChain Expression Language is not necessary; we will cover it in depth in this course.
Intermediate Python Knowledge: You should be comfortable with object-oriented programming, functions, modules, and other basics required to write professional code.
Docker: We will use PGVector, a Postgres database with vector extension, in a container.
Why Take This Course on Advanced RAG?
After the LLM hype began with GPT-3.5, many companies attempted to build LLM-based chatbots for various use cases. The challenge for companies is that GPT models or other open-source models lack knowledge of company-specific data, as these models were not trained with that information.

A popular approach to enable an LLM to work with a companyâ€™s data is to use a vector database and perform a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow. In this workflow...

Basic RAG Ingestion and Retrieval Workflow
Initially, LLMs were treated like wizards. However, disillusionment quickly set in as models began to hallucinate, provide incorrect information, respond in poor style, and clever users exploited the systems. For example, users in Canada successfully claimed a refund for flights (https://techhq.com/2024/02/air-canada-refund-for-customer-who-used-chatbot/) because an LLM-based chatbot had erroneously informed them they would receive one.

As a result there was a push to develop concepts to improve the performance of these RAG systems. Various techniques can enhance both the ingestion and retrieval steps of the system.

Techniques You Will Learn
You will learn various techniques, but the goal is to implement only those that genuinely improve your chatbot's performance.

Tools for Evaluation and Improvement
To achieve this, several tools are available. We will explore RAGAS for evaluating RAG pipelines and LangFlow, the open-source version of LangSmith, which we will use to analyze the retrieval stage in detail.

Additionally, you will learn about Nemo Guardrails, an open-source tool from NVIDIA, designed to protect your chatbot from prompt injections, jailbreaks, and other vulnerabilities.

Before diving into these advanced techniques, we will begin with an in-depth look at the LangChain Expression Language. If you are already proficient with LCEL, you may skip this chapter.
